# Candy Ranking

This repository contains code used for processing data from my Candy Survey. See https://forms.gle/1k4UdBNn347GZjSG6 if you would like to fill out a response that will be used in a later iteration of any articles from this project.

Currently, I have two articles that use code from this repository:

* https://maxcandocia.com/article/2020/Oct/28/us-candy-voting/ (How Would the US Vote for a Candy?)

* https://maxcandocia.com/article/2020/Nov/13/candy-bundles/ (Candy Combinations for Bundling)

I will eventually add the cleaned source data here, although I will be analyzing it thoroughly before doing so.
