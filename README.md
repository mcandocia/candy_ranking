# Candy Ranking

This repository contains code used for processing data from my Candy Survey. See https://forms.gle/1k4UdBNn347GZjSG6 if you would like to fill out a response that will be used in a later iteration of any articles from this project.

Currently, I have one article that uses code from this repository: https://maxcandocia.com/article/2020/Oct/28/us-candy-voting/

I will eventually add the cleaned source data here, although I will be analyzing it thoroughly before doing so.
